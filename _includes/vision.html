	The curriculum will focus on higher-order design thinking and strategic work that exists above the layer artificial intelligence is currently automating. Rather than competing with automation, students will learn to leverage emerging technologies while developing uniquely human capabilities that AI cannot replicate. 
</p>
<p>
	The program structure intentionally builds adaptability into every aspect of the learning experience, ensuring graduates can pivot between design disciplines, work modalities, and evolving industry demands. By integrating emerging technologies throughout the curriculum and emphasizing process over perfection, the degree prepares students not just for their first job, but for a dynamic career spanning multiple roles, industries, and employment structures. 
</p>
<p>
	The program moves beyond traditional graphic design silos to address user experience, systems thinking, service design, campaign strategy, and multichannel content creation. Students will work across media platforms (print, digital, interactive, immersive AR/VR, motion) and engage with real-world challenges through industry partnerships, collaborative studios, and hackathon-style problem-solving. 
</p>
<p>
	A fundamental shift in assessment will redefine what constitutes a successful portfolio. Instead of showcasing only polished final artifacts, students will document their decision-making processes, demonstrating their ability to navigate ambiguity and handle complex responsibilities. This approach proves to potential employers and clients that graduates can be trusted with strategic thinking and problem-solving in uncertain contexts. 
</p>
<p>
	This breadth prepares graduates to pivot between design disciplines and work modalities as industry demands shift, while maintaining depth in visual communication, brand strategy, and human-centered design principles.
