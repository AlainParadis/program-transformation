<h4>
	Program Value Proposition 
</h4>
<p>
	The field of graphic design is fulfilling, profitable career, notwithstanding the perceived challenges posed by automation and artificial intelligence. 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Graphic design is a human-centred discipline.</li>
	<ul>
		<li> AI can generate content, but it can’t originate meaningful, strategic, or emotionally resonant design. Graphic designers are the ones who give AI direction, context, and purpose. The future of design is human-led, AI-enhanced.</li>
		<li> Design is everywhere, from branding and user-experience design to motion graphics and packaging. The demand for visual communication is growing, not shrinking. In fact, companies need designers more than ever to stand out in a noisy, digital world.</li>
		<li> Design is a tech-adjacent field. Graphic designers work in app development, digital marketing, gaming, and even healthcare communications. It’s not either/or, it’s design + tech.</li>
		<li> Algonquin’s Graphic Design program is built around hands-on learning, industry partnerships, and portfolio development. Graduates leave with real-world experience and a job-ready portfolio, not just a diploma.</li>
	</ul>
