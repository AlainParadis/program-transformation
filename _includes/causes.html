	Though one year of lower registrations doesn't make a trend, these are possible causes for what we're seeing across program in our school within the college. 
</p>
<p>
	Broader societal trends may be at play. Concerns about job security, automation, and AI in creative industries could be discouraging students from pursuing a career in graphic design. 
</p>
<p>
	Parents and students may be opting for programs perceived as more future-proof or directly tied to high-demand sectors like tech or healthcare.

<p>
	<em>Historical prestige and perception.</em> Universities have traditionally been seen as the path to professional careers (law, medicine, academia), while colleges have been associated with trades and applied skills. This has led to a perception that university education is more <i>intellectual</i> or <i>elite</i>, while college is more <i>practical</i> or <i>vocational</i>. 
</p>
<p>
	<em>Parental and societal expectations.</em> Many parents, especially those from immigrant or middle-class backgrounds, view university as a status symbol or a guarantee of upward mobility. Guidance counselors and high school systems often steer high-achieving students toward university, reinforcing the misconception. 
</p>
<p>
	<em>Labour market misconceptions.</em> There’s a misalignment between perception and reality. Many college grads in applied fields (like design, tech, and healthcare) earn more and find work faster than some university grads. This data is not always well-communicated to students or parents. 
</p>
<p>
	<em>Media and cultural narratives.</em> Popular media often portrays university life as the <i>default</i> post-secondary experience. College programs, especially in the arts, are underrepresented or stereotyped.
