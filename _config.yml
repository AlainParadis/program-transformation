    This site contains high-level blue-sky ideas to address the falling registration numbers in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. These ideas aim to appeal to a broader audience by proposing new, shorter, less costly credentials to address the challenging time and financial commitment of a three-year Ontario College Advanced Diploma. It also speaks to concerns related to automation and artificial intelligence in the creative design sector.
