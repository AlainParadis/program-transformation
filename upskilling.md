<h3>What Are Micro-Credentials?</h3>
<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/micro-credentials-ontarios-postsecondary-schools" target="_blank">Micro-credentials</a> are short, focused training programs offered by Ontarioâ€™s colleges, universities, Indigenous Institutes, and career colleges. They are designed to take less time than traditional degrees or diplomas. They're flexible, often available online, including on-the-job training or practical components. They can be developed in collaboration with industry partners to ensure relevance.

There may be funding available from the province to develop micro-credentials through the  <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1004681/ontario-supporting-more-industry-focused-training-programs" target="_blank">Ontario Micro-credentials Challenge Fund</a>.

Many micro-credentials are eligible for OSAP funding. Learners can apply for grants and loans through [OSAP for Micro-credentials](https://www.ontario.ca/page/osap-ontario-student-assistance-program). They must register with the institution first, then apply for OSAP if the program is approved
