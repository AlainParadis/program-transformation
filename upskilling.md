<h3>
	What Are Micro-Credentials? 
</h3>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/micro-credentials-ontarios-postsecondary-schools" target="_blank">Micro-credentials</a> are short, focused training programs offered by Ontarioâ€™s colleges. They are designed to take less time than traditional degrees or diplomas. They're flexible, often available online, including on-the-job training or practical components. They can be developed in collaboration with industry partners to ensure relevance. 
</p>
<p>
	Micro-credentials may be sponsored by employers, supported by government or organizational funding or self-funded. Many micro-credentials are eligible for <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/osap-ontario-student-assistance-program">OSAP funding</a>. There may also be funding available for curriculum development through the <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1004681/ontario-supporting-more-industry-focused-training-programs" target="_blank">Ontario Micro-credentials Challenge Fund</a>.

<h4>
	Who They Serve
</h4>
<p>
	Ontario college micro-credentials serve a diverse range of learners and organisations. Individuals looking to pivot into a new field often seek short, targeted training to quickly build foundational skills, while workers aiming to stay current in their industry use these credentials to maintain their expertise. Recent college or university graduates frequently pursue micro-credentials to specialise further or acquire practical skills not covered in their degree, thereby improving their employability. 
</p>
<p>
	Organisations also invest in micro-credentials to train staff in specific competencies, utilising them for professional development purposes. Additionally, freelance designers may use micro-credentials to broaden their service offerings. Finally, individuals returning to education after time in the workforce find micro-credentials a flexible and efficient way to re-engage with learning and gain relevant qualifications.
