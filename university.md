title: University Outreach
---

<p>
	University grads bring maturity, focus, and life experience to the classroom. Their presence elevates the learning environment—for themselves and for their peers.

	“Bring your degree. Bring your drive. Shape the next generation of design.”

<h3>
	Motivators 
</h3>
<p>
	These are motivators for university students to attend the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li> <em>Career Direction</em>: Turn broad academic knowledge into a focused, employable skill set.</li>
	<li> <em>Creative Application</em>: Channel artistic instincts into a rewarding design career.</li>
	<li> <em>Portfolio Development</em>: Build a professional portfolio that opens doors in competitive industries.</li>
	<li> <em>Job Market Readiness</em>: Gain practical, in-demand skills that lead directly to employment.</li>
	<li> <em>Industry Exposure</em>: Connect with professionals, clients, and mentors through hands-on projects.</li>
	<li> <em>Collaborative Learning</em>: Work alongside diverse peers, including high school grads, in a studio setting.</li>
	<li> <em>Confidence Building</em>: Learn to present, defend, and refine ideas in a professional context.</li>
	<li> <em>Tool Mastery</em>: Get fluent in Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, and other essential platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Channels 
</h3>
<p>
	We can assume the universities will not welcome our appeal to their students to attend Algonquin since they'll want them for graduate studies. Our communications cannot go through institutional channels. We'll need to use the following to reach them. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Student Clubs & Societies</em>: Art, media, or design clubs often run events and have mailing lists or social media pages.</li>
	<li><em>Campus Newspapers & Magazines</em>: Submit an article or ad about transitioning from theory to practice through Algonquin’s program.</li>
	<li><em>Social Media Groups</em>: Look for unofficial student Facebook groups, Discord servers, or Reddit threads where students share opportunities.</li>
	<li><em>Alumni Networks</em>: Reach out to recent grads who made the transition and ask them to share their story with peers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Additional Research
</h3>
<p>
	There are areas of interest for further investigation such as articulation agreements and academic pathways. Currently, Algonquin College seems to focus primarily on college-to-university rather than high school-to-college agreements.
