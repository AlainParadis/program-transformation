<h4>
	Motivators 
</h4>
<p>
	For university Arts students, the Graphic Design program offers a clear path from academic exploration to creative employment. It’s a chance to apply artistic instincts in real-world contexts, build a professional portfolio, and master industry-standard tools. With hands-on learning, career-focused training, and exposure to design professionals, the program empowers students to turn their degree into a dynamic, job-ready skill set. 
</p>
<blockquote>
	“Bring your degree. Bring your drive. Shape the next generation of design.” 
</blockquote>
<p>
	Furthermore, university grads bring maturity, focus, and life experience to the our college classrooms. Their presence elevates the learning environment, for themselves and for their peers. 
</p>
<h4>
	A (new?) Competitive Posture 
</h4>
<p>
	The frugal approach of the provincial government towards higher education institution (HEI) funding compels us to operate as private enterprise organizations, pursuing alternative, innovative revenue streams. In this evolving landscape, institutions must acknowledge and adapt to the reality of inter-institutional competition. Accordingly, it is both strategic and appropriate to actively recruit students from neighbouring universities in order to sustain and grow enrolment in our programs.

<h4>
	Channels 
</h4>
<p>
	It is reasonable to expect that universities may prefer their students continue into graduate studies within their own institutions. They may be less receptive to our outreach efforts. As such, it would be prudent to avoid using formal institutional channels for our marketing outreach. Instead, we will focus on the following alternative strategies to reach prospective students effectively. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Student Clubs & Societies</em>: Art, media, or design clubs often run events and have mailing lists or social media pages.</li>
	<li><em>Campus Newspapers & Magazines</em>: Submit an article or ad about transitioning from theory to practice through Algonquin’s program.</li>
	<li><em>Social Media Groups</em>: Look for unofficial student Facebook groups, Discord servers, or Reddit threads where students share opportunities.</li>
	<li><em>Alumni Networks</em>: Reach out to recent grads who made the transition and ask them to share their story with peers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Key Messaging 
</h4>
<p>
	Consistent, persuasive and targeted messaging has the power to attract university Arts grads to our program. 
</p>
<blockquote>
	Turn your Arts degree into a career with Algonquin’s Graphic Design program—where creativity meets employability. 
</blockquote>
<p>
	The benefits listed above contain the messaging that needs to be communicated in the specified channels.
</p>
<h4>
	Lay Out the Welcome Mat 
</h4>
<p>
	All efforts should be used to reduce administrative friction in welcoming and enrolling university learners. Some strategies could include implementing a simplified, tailored application process for the university-to-college pathway. Could there be financial incentives such as recognizing university students who meet certain academic criteria, or waiving application or registration fees for university transfers? More research is needed here.
