<h4>
	Motivators 
</h4>
<p>
	High school students are drawn to Graphic Design because it offers a vibrant outlet for creative expression and a pathway to exciting careers in branding, UX Design, motion graphics, and digital media. The program’s hands-on, studio-based learning environment makes education feel active and engaging, while industry-standard tools and portfolio development prepare students for real-world opportunities. It’s a chance to join a community of like-minded creatives and turn passion into profession. 
</p>
<h4>
	Outreach Activities 
</h4>
<p>
	These are ideas for potential outreach activities in local high schools. 
</p>
<ol>

	</ul>
	<li>Design Futures Career Fair Booth</li>
	<ul>

	<li>Canterbury High School Arts Program</li>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://canterburyhs.ocdsb.ca/academics-landing/arts-canterbury">Canterbury Arts</a></li>
		<li>Canterbury High School is the OCDSB&#39;s flagship arts-focused high school, offering the renowned Arts Canterbury Program with specialized streams in Dance, Drama, Music, Visual Arts, and Literary Arts. Entry is audition-based and the program is nationally recognized for excellence, making it ideal for students dedicated to the arts. Its unique full-time arts curriculum and vibrant creative community set it apart.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Merivale High School Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) Arts and Culture</li>
	<ul>

		<li>Jaclyn Canas - SHSM Lead Coordinator, <a href="mailto:jaclyn.canas@ocdsb.ca.ca">jaclyn.canas@ocdsb.ca.ca</a></li>
		<li>Merivale High School offers the SHSM in Arts and Culture, with a focus on communication and design. This program integrates traditional and digital arts, including painting, drawing, photography, graphic design, video, and animation, along with industry certifications and portfolio development. It is tailored for students interested in arts with a professional or design-oriented pathway. Unlike Canterbury, Merivale does not require an audition for the SHSM but focuses on senior students (grade 11-12) and blends arts learning with technical and community projects.</li>

<h3>
	Additional Research 
</h3>
<h4>
	Required Resources 
</h4>
<p>
	Resources will be required to develop and produce printed materials to distribute at these activities. Faculty will also require release time to initiate communications with teachers and department heads, to design and produce these materials, and to attend activities at high schools. We can collaborate with the college's marketing department for this work, but we would appreciate input into messaging since we're program stakeholders. 
</p>
<h4>
	Academic Pathways 
</h4>
<p>
	There are areas of interest needing further investigation. Currently, Algonquin College seems to focus primarily on college-to-university rather than high school-to-college agreements. <em>Is it possible to build pathway agreements with local highschools?</em> Conversations with Jessica DeVries, Chair for Academic Development may be in order, as well as with Admissions.

<h5>
	School-College-Work Initiative (SCWI) 
</h5>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/dual-credit-programs" target="_blank">SCWI</a> is a province-wide program in Ontario designed to support student success and smooth transitions from high school to college or apprenticeship training. It plays a central role in coordinating <em>dual credit programs</em>, which are a key part of its mandate. 
</p>
<p>
	SCWI aims to encourage students to pursue postsecondary education. It provides meaningful learning experiences that connect classroom learning to real-world careers 
</p>
<p>
	Next Steps: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Speak with high school guidance counsellors</li>
	<li>Explore opportunities through the local school board</li>
</ul>
<h5>
	Dual Credit Programs 
</h5>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/dual-credit-programs" target="_blank">Dual credit programs in Ontario</a> are designed to help high school students transition more smoothly into postsecondary education. They allow eligible high school students to take college courses that count toward both their Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) and a college diploma. 
</p>
<p>
	Participating in a dual credit program can help students complete their high school diploma, transition successfully to college or apprenticeship programs while exploring career pathways and gaining exposure to college-level expectations and environments. 
</p>
<p>
	Note that students enrolled in a <em>Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM)</em> programs such as Merivale HS and Canterbury HS are eligible.
