<h4>
	Motivators 
</h4>
<p>
	High school students are drawn to Graphic Design because it offers a vibrant outlet for creative expression and a pathway to exciting careers in branding, UX Design, motion graphics, and digital media. The program’s hands-on, studio-based learning environment makes education feel active and engaging, while industry-standard tools and portfolio development prepare students for real-world opportunities. It’s a chance to join a community of like-minded creatives and turn passion into profession. 
</p>
<blockquote>
	“Turn your creativity into a career.” 
</blockquote>
<p>
    There are a number of highschools that offer a Specialist High Skills Major in Arts and Culture (<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/document/specialist-high-skills-major-policy-and-implementation-guide/arts-and-culture" target="_target">SHSM, Arts and Culture</a>).

<h4>
	<a name="channels">Channels </a>
</h4>
<p>
	Outreach to high schools offers multiple channels both in-person and online. The first high schools to target are those participating in the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/document/specialist-high-skills-major-policy-and-implementation-guide/arts-and-culture">Specialist High Skills Major, Arts and Culture</a> program. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Key individuals in high schools</em>: including department heads and arts faculty.</li>
	<li><em>Social Media Groups</em>: Look for unofficial student Facebook groups, Discord servers, or Reddit threads where students share opportunities.</li>
	<li><em>Alumni Networks</em>: Reach out to recent grads who made the transition and ask them to share their story with peers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We could initiate conversations with high school program heads and explore opportunities through the school board.
