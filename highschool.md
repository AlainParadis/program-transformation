<h4>
	Motivators 
</h4>
<p>
	High school students are drawn to Graphic Design because it offers a vibrant outlet for creative expression and a pathway to exciting careers in branding, UX Design, motion graphics, and digital media. The program’s hands-on, studio-based learning environment makes education feel active and engaging, while industry-standard tools and portfolio development prepare students for real-world opportunities. It’s a chance to join a community of like-minded creatives and turn passion into profession. 
</p>

<h4>
	Channels 
</h4>
<p>
	Outreach to high schools offers multiple channels both in-person and online. The first high schools to target are those participating in the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/document/specialist-high-skills-major-policy-and-implementation-guide/arts-and-culture">Specialist High Skills Major, Arts and Culture</a> program. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Key individuals in high schools</em>: including department heads and arts faculty.</li>
	<li><em>Social Media Groups</em>: Look for unofficial student Facebook groups, Discord servers, or Reddit threads where students share opportunities.</li>

<h4>
	Key Messaging

<h3>
	Additional Research 
</h3>
<h4>
	Academic Pathways 
</h4>
<p>
	There are areas of interest needing further investigation. Currently, Algonquin College seems to focus primarily on college-to-university rather than high school-to-college agreements. <em>Is it possible to build pathway agreements with local highschools?</em> Conversations with Jessica DeVries, Chair for Academic Development may be in order, as well as with Admissions. 
</p>
<h5>
	School-College-Work Initiative (SCWI) 
</h5>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/dual-credit-programs" target="_blank">SCWI</a> is a province-wide program in Ontario designed to support student success and smooth transitions from high school to college or apprenticeship training. It plays a central role in coordinating <em>dual credit programs</em>, which are a key part of its mandate. 
</p>
<p>
	SCWI aims to encourage students to pursue postsecondary education. It provides meaningful learning experiences that connect classroom learning to real-world careers 
</p>
<p>
	Next Steps: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Speak with high school guidance counsellors</li>
	<li>Explore opportunities through the local school board</li>
</ul>
<h5>
	Dual Credit Programs 
</h5>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/dual-credit-programs" target="_blank">Dual credit programs in Ontario</a> are designed to help high school students transition more smoothly into postsecondary education. They allow eligible high school students to take college courses that count toward both their Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) and a college diploma. 
</p>
<p>
	Participating in a dual credit program can help students complete their high school diploma, transition successfully to college or apprenticeship programs while exploring career pathways and gaining exposure to college-level expectations and environments. 
</p>
<p>
	Note that students enrolled in a <em>Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM)</em> programs such as Merivale HS and Canterbury HS are eligible. 
</p>
<h4>

		<li>We could leave behind a mini portfolio zine or QR code to a student gallery.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Design Futures Career Fair Booth</li>
	<ul>
