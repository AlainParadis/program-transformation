	<li>Canterbury High School Arts Program</li>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://canterburyhs.ocdsb.ca/academics-landing/arts-canterbury">Canterbury Arts</a></li>
		<li>Canterbury High School is the OCDSB&#39;s flagship arts-focused high school, offering the renowned Arts Canterbury Program with specialized streams in Dance, Drama, Music, Visual Arts, and Literary Arts. Entry is audition-based and the program is nationally recognized for excellence, making it ideal for students dedicated to the arts. Its unique full-time arts curriculum and vibrant creative community set it apart.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Merivale High School Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) Arts and Culture</li>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/ocdsb.ca/merivale-finearts/specialist-high-skills-major">Merivale SHSM Program</a></li>
		<li>Jaclyn Canas - SHSM Lead Coordinator, <a href="mailto:jaclyn.canas@ocdsb.ca.ca">jaclyn.canas@ocdsb.ca.ca</a></li>
		<li>Merivale High School offers the SHSM in Arts and Culture, with a focus on communication and design. This program integrates traditional and digital arts, including painting, drawing, photography, graphic design, video, and animation, along with industry certifications and portfolio development. It is tailored for students interested in arts with a professional or design-oriented pathway. Unlike Canterbury, Merivale does not require an audition for the SHSM but focuses on senior students (grade 11-12) and blends arts learning with technical and community projects.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>
	Required Resources 
</h3>
<p>
	Resources will be required to develop and produce printed materials to distribute at these activities. Faculty will also require release time to initiate communications with teachers and department heads, to design and produce these materials, and to attend activities at high schools. We can collaborate with the college's marketing department for this work, but we would appreciate input into messaging since we're program stakeholders.
