The NOC code 52120 for Graphic Designers and Illustrators is a critical reference for promoting Algonquin College's Graphic Design program. It connects the program to recognized national career pathways, highlighting employability and relevance to prospective students, guidance counsellors, employers, and policymakers.

### Key Uses for Program Promotion

- The NOC code demonstrates that the program aligns with recognized occupational standards, ensuring skills and training are mapped to real labour market demand.
- It allows Algonquin College to show how program outcomes match the needs of employers looking for skills in visual communication, design software, typography, motion graphics, and interactive media.
- Using the NOC code signals to potential students—including international applicants—that the program leads to clearly defined, in-demand jobs in Canada, which may support immigration pathways or work permit eligibility.

### Supporting Labour Market Information

- The NOC code can be used to directly link to data about salaries, job openings, regional demand, and employment prospects, making it easier to persuade prospective students of the program’s value.
- The code also allows colleges to compare their program outcomes with national benchmarks, refine curriculum, and report success rates that are meaningful to prospective students and accrediting bodies.

### Strengthening Recruitment and Messaging

- Citing NOC 52120 in program materials connects Algonquin’s Graphic Design diploma to established, high-skill professions tracked by Statistics Canada and federal immigration streams.
- This is particularly persuasive for students seeking a credential that leads to a well-defined, supported career pathway in Canada’s creative industries.

Using this NOC code frames the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College as directly relevant and valuable for careers in Canada, linking education to clear professional outcomes and supporting more targeted, effective promotion of the program.
