<h4>
	Key Messaging 
</h4>
<p>
	Consistent, persuasive and targeted messaging has the power to attract high school grads to our program. 
</p>
<blockquote>
	“Find tools, community, and real-world experience with Algonquin’s Graphic Design program—where creativity meets employability.” 
</blockquote>

The listed benefits contain the messaging that needs to be communicated in the specified channels.

<ul>
  {% for message in site.data.sitewide.messaging %}
    <li>{{ message }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

There's also material that can be used to promote the program such as <em>applicant portfolio pieces</em>, <em>student assignment samples</em>, and <em>alumni industry work</em>. 
<h4>
	Lead Capturing and Tracking 
</h4>
<p>
	During school visits, we'll collect key contact information from prospective applicants so we can follow up with them. 
</p>
<p>
	It would be great to deploy an email campaign with tailored information for each applicant, including key calls to action. We'll need to emphasise prompt follow-up, such as thanking students for participating, reminding them to complete next steps at suitable times, and answering questions quickly. 
</p>
<p>
    We can use existing tools included in Microsoft Office to track and share data with college stakeholders. MS Forms can capture lead contact information, saving data to Excel. Outlook can send tailored mail-merged messages. We're open to working with admissions to track leads.

Subject: Meeting Request

Dear [recipient name],

My name is Alain Paradis. I coordinate and teach in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. I am reaching out to connect with you as part of our efforts to support students exploring creative post-secondary paths.

I would like to propose a meeting. The agenda would be to discuss a possible classroom visit, where I could share details about our Graphic Design program and answer student questions. Our program develops skills in creative thinking, design methods, and digital tools that we believe are valued by employers.

Please let me know your availability. We can hold this initial meeting virtually, if that's easier for you. I will do my best to fit your schedule. I look forward to meeting and working together to help students consider graphic design as an exciting next step.
