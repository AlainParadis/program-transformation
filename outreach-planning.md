<h4>
	Key Messaging 
</h4>
<p>
	Consistent, persuasive and targeted messaging has the power to attract high school grads to our program. 
</p>
<blockquote>
	“Find tools, community, and real-world experience with Algonquin’s Graphic Design program—where creativity meets employability.” 
</blockquote>
<p>
	The <a href="highschool.html">listed benefits</a> contain the messaging that needs to be communicated in the specified channels. There's also material that can be used to promote the program such as <em>applicant portfolio pieces</em>, <em>student assignment samples</em>, and <em>alumni industry work</em>. 
</p>
<h4>
	Outreach Activities 
</h4>
<p>
	These are ideas for potential outreach activities in local high schools. 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>“Design in Action” High School Workshop Series</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Bring a hands-on, 1-hour design challenge into art or media classes. Students get a taste of real design thinking. We get to showcase the program’s energy and relevance.</li>
		<li>We could leave behind Algonquin branded merch, like a sketch book.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Design Futures Career Fair Booth</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Set up a visually striking booth at local and regional high school career fairs.</li>
		<li>Feature student work, interactive demos, and a “Design Your Future” handout that connects creativity to real careers.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Teacher Partnership Program</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Build relationships with art/media teachers by offering:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Guest lectures or virtual talks from faculty or alumni</li>
			<li>Free classroom resources (e.g., design challenge kits)</li>
			<li>Invitations to student showcases or portfolio nights </li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>“Design Day @ Algonquin”</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Host an annual on-campus event for high school students. Include:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Mini workshops</li>
			<li>Portfolio reviews</li>
			<li>Swag and snacks to make it memorable</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ol>
<h4>
	Eliciting Interest 
</h4>
<p>
	When meeting with high school students, they'll need to be drawn out by centring the discussion on their reasons for joining an arts program to foster engagement. These are some prompts. 
</p>
<blockquote class="small">
	“Everyone has their own reasons for being here. I’d love to hear what made you choose the arts.” 
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="small">
	“What do you enjoy most about making art?” 
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="small">
	“What made you excited to join this program?” 
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="small">
	“Was there a particular project, artist, or experience that made you want to pursue the arts?” 
</blockquote>
<p>
	We can encourage brief sharing in pairs or small groups before asking for volunteers to speak out.
