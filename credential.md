	While the current three-year program is successful, this initiative requires that we explore alternatives to address current and evolving external and internal factors. The following represent ideas for new credentials within the field of graphic design. 
</p>
<dl> 
	<dt>Decision scope:</dt>
	<dd>Should the Algonquin College Graphic Design program maintain an Advanced Diploma, pursue 3-year applied degree, or pursue an alternative (e.g., pathways/articulations).</dd>
</dl>
<p>
	Canada’s federal Job Bank states that graphic designers <i>typically</i> need either a university degree in visual arts with a specialization in graphic design or completion of a college diploma in graphic arts/graphic design.
