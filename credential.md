	While the current three-year program is successful, this initiative requires that we explore alternatives to address current and evolving external and internal factors. The following represent ideas for new credentials within the field of graphic design. 
</p>
<dl> 
	<dt>Decision scope:</dt>
	<dd>Should the Algonquin College Graphic Design program maintain an Advanced Diploma, pursue 3-year applied degree, or pursue an alternative (e.g., pathways/articulations).</dd>
</dl>
<p>
	For what it's worth, Canada’s federal Job Bank states that graphic designers <i>typically</i> need either a university degree in visual arts with a specialization in graphic design or completion of a college diploma in graphic arts/graphic design. That could simply be because it's the most common credential in the field. A degree could be more attractive and beneficial nonetheless.

<h4>
	Faculty Credentials 
</h4>
<p>
	The minimum credential for faculty teaching in a 3-year applied degree program is the terminal credential, which is a Master's degree. Fifty percent of <i>core courses</i> are taught by Master's holders. There's a minimum of five years' of work experience. All faculty are required to maintain currency in their field. There are no requirements for professional credentials.
