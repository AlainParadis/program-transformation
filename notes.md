#### Program Promo Notes

-   During school visits, we'll need a way to collect key contact information from prospective applicants. Will the college want this information for the CRM, or can we deal with it at a program level?
-   What are the important dates for applying to the 26F semester?
-   Can we offer these students some type of advantage, since they're already in an arts program?

-   We'd like Jed back in the program.
-   The Graphic Design program is an Ontario Colleges Program Standard.
-   What do you think of our faculty working with Student Recruitment, Marketing to market the program to highschool students?
