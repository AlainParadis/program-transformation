-   What are your thoughts on the current state of the program?
-   Does the college have a theory to explain the low enrolment numbers?
-   The cancelled applications are concerning. Do you know what happened?
    -   No one from the cancelled list ended up in the program.

-   The Graphic Design program is an Ontario Colleges Program Standard.
-   What do you think of our faculty working with Student Recruitment, Marketing to market the program to highschool students?
