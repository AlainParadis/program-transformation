title: Rationale
---
This document contains high-level blue-sky ideas to address the falling registration numbers in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. These ideas aim to appeal to a broader audience by proposing new, shorter, less costly credentials to address the challenging time and financial commitment of a three-year Ontario College Advanced Diploma. It also speaks to concerns related to automation and artificial intelligence in the creative design sector. 
<h3>
	Low Registrations: Possible Causes
</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Proximal</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Broader societal trends may be at play. Concerns about job security, automation, and AI in creative industries could be discouraging students from pursuing a career in graphic design.</li>
		<li>Parents and students may be opting for programs perceived as more *future-proof* or directly tied to high-demand sectors like tech or healthcare.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Distal</li>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Historical prestige and perception.</em> Universities have traditionally been seen as the path to professional careers (law, medicine, academia), while colleges have been associated with trades and applied skills. This has led to a perception that university education is more *intellectual* or *elite*, while college is more *practical* or *vocational*.</li>
		<li><em>Parental and societal expectations.</em> Many parents, especially those from immigrant or middle-class backgrounds, view university as a status symbol or a guarantee of upward mobility. Guidance counselors and high school systems often steer high-achieving students toward university, reinforcing the misconception.</li>
		<li><em>Labour market misconceptions.</em> There’s a misalignment between perception and reality. Many college grads in applied fields (like design, tech, and healthcare) earn more and find work faster than some university grads. This data is not always well-communicated to students or parents.</li>
		<li><em>Media and cultural narratives.</em> Popular media often portrays university life as the *default* post-secondary experience. College programs, especially in the arts, are underrepresented or stereotyped.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
<h2>
	Value Proposition
</h2>
The field of graphic design is fulfilling, profitable career, notwithstanding the perceived challenges posed by automation and artificial intelligence. 
<ol>
	<li>Graphic design is a human-centred discipline.</li>
	<ul>
		<li> AI can generate content, but it can’t originate meaningful, strategic, or emotionally resonant design. Graphic designers are the ones who give AI direction, context, and purpose. The future of design is human-led, AI-enhanced.</li>
		<li> Design is everywhere, from branding and user-experience design to motion graphics and packaging. The demand for visual communication is growing, not shrinking. In fact, companies need designers more than ever to stand out in a noisy, digital world.</li>
		<li> Design is a tech-adjacent field. Graphic designers work in app development, digital marketing, gaming, and even healthcare communications. It’s not either/or, it’s design + tech.</li>
		<li> Algonquin’s Graphic Design program is built around hands-on learning, industry partnerships, and portfolio development. Graduates leave with real-world experience and a job-ready portfolio, not just a diploma.</li>
	</ul>
	<li> The reality of college experience:</li>
	<ul>
		<li> Smaller class sizes</li>
		<li> Hands-on, industry-relevant training</li>
		<li> Strong employment outcomes</li>
		<li> Pathways to university degrees</li>
	</ul>
</ol>

	Program Promotion
</h2>
<h3>
	Audience
</h3>
<ol>
	<li>High Schools</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Large numbers, low-hanging fruit.</li>
		<li>Attracted by the *cool factor* and creative potential.</li>
		<li>Motivated by transforming their innate creative talent into a fulfilling, profitable career.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>University Arts Grads</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Motivated by *career readiness* and practical skills.</li>
		<li>Industry connections gained through mentorship, guest speakers, and fieldwork.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Up-Skilling</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Create micro-credentials to appeal to professionals who wish to add to their existing skill sets.</li>

<h2>New Programs Architecture</h2>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Ontario Colleges Advanced Diploma</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Existing three-year program</li>
		<li><strong>Pros</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Well established</li>
			<li>Excellent reputation</li>
			<li>Deep learning of the craft</li>
			<li>Record of ever-evolving curriculum</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Cons</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Significant time commitment—three years</li>
			<li>Significant financial burden</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Ontario Colleges Diploma</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Two-year program</li>
		<li>Appeal to international students?</li>
		<li><strong>Pros</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Shorter time to graduation, workforce</li>
			<li>Lower cost</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Cons</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Time to implementation</li>
			<li>Missing third-year WIL experiences</li>
			<li>Missing third-year advanced curriculum</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Micro-Credentials</strong><ul>
		<li>Micro-credentials are short, focused learning experiences designed to help learners quickly gain specific skills or knowledge.</li>
		<li>They may appeal to alumni of our program who wish to update their skills. They can also appeal to professionals not in the field of design who need to add particular skills. i.e. An administrative assistant who needs to make more appealing slide presentations.</li>
		<li><strong>Pros</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Flexible: Often self-paced or part-time.</li>
			<li>Stackable: Can be combined with other micro-credentials or formal education.</li>
			<li>Industry-Aligned: Developed in collaboration with employers to meet current job market needs.</li>
			<li>Verifiable: Usually come with a digital badge or certificate.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Cons</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Employers may not value micro-credentials as highly as traditional degrees or diplomas.</li>
			<li>Standardization across institutions is lacking, making it hard to compare credentials.</li>
			<li>Micro-credentials often teach specific skills, which may not provide the broader context or critical thinking that full programs offer.</li>
			<li>They may not prepare learners for career shifts or leadership roles.</li>
			<li>Learners may accumulate many micro-credentials without a cohesive educational pathway.</li>
			<li>This can lead to disconnected knowledge and limited depth in any one area.</li>
			<li>Some micro-credentials are not publicly funded, making them less accessible to low-income learners.</li>
			<li>They may favour learners who already have a strong educational foundation.</li>
			<li>As more micro-credentials flood the market, their value may diminish unless rigor and quality are maintained.</li>
			<li>Employers may become overwhelmed by the variety and unsure how to interpret them.</li>
			<li>Micro-credentials may not transfer easily between institutions or count toward formal qualifications. This limits their usefulness for learners seeking to ladder up to diplomas or degrees.</li>
			<li>The focus on immediate employability can sideline foundational learning, creativity, and exploration.</li>
			<li>This may not serve students well in evolving industries like design, where adaptability and conceptual thinking are key.</li>
		</ul>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Potential areas of study within the practice of graphic design:</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Graphic Design fundamentals (contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity)</li>
		<li>Build better slide decks</li>
		<li>…</li>
	</ul>
