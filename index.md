## Rationale

This document contains high-level blue-sky ideas to address the falling registration numbers in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. These ideas aim to appeal to a broader audience by proposing new, shorter, less costly credentials to address the challenging time and financial commitment of a three-year Ontario College Advanced Diploma. It also speaks to concerns related to automation and artificial intelligence in the creative design sector.

### Low Registrations: Possible Causes

1.   Proximal:
    -   Broader societal trends may be at play. Concerns about job security, automation, and AI in creative industries could be discouraging students from pursuing a career in graphic design.
    -   Parents and students may be opting for programs perceived as more *future-proof* or directly tied to high-demand sectors like tech or healthcare.
2.   Distal:
    -   **Historical prestige and perception.** Universities have traditionally been seen as the path to professional careers (law, medicine, academia), while colleges have been associated with trades and applied skills. This has led to a perception that university education is more *intellectual* or *elite*, while college is more *practical* or *vocational*.
    -   **Parental and societal expectations.** Many parents, especially those from immigrant or middle-class backgrounds, view university as a status symbol or a guarantee of upward mobility. Guidance counselors and high school systems often steer high-achieving students toward university, reinforcing the misconception.
    -   **Labour market misconceptions.** There’s a misalignment between perception and reality. Many college grads in applied fields (like design, tech, and healthcare) earn more and find work faster than some university grads. This data is not always well-communicated to students or parents.
    -   **Media and cultural narratives.** Popular media often portrays university life as the *default* post-secondary experience. College programs, especially in the arts, are underrepresented or stereotyped.

## Value Proposition

The field of graphic design is fulfilling, profitable career, notwithstanding the perceived challenges posed by automation and artificial intelligence.

-   Graphic design is a human-centred discipline.
    -   AI can generate content, but it can’t originate meaningful, strategic, or emotionally resonant design. Graphic designers are the ones who give AI direction, context, and purpose. The future of design is human-led, AI-enhanced.
    -   Design is everywhere, from branding and user-experience design to motion graphics and packaging. The demand for visual communication is growing, not shrinking. In fact, companies need designers more than ever to stand out in a noisy, digital world.
    -   Design is a tech-adjacent field. Graphic designers work in app development, digital marketing, gaming, and even healthcare communications. It’s not either/or—it’s design + tech.
    -   Algonquin’s Graphic Design program is built around hands-on learning, industry partnerships, and portfolio development. Graduates leave with real-world experience and a job-ready portfolio, not just a diploma.
-   The reality of college experience:
    -   Smaller class sizes
    -   Hands-on, industry-relevant training
    -   Strong employment outcomes
    -   Pathways to university degrees
