<p>
	While the current three-year program is successful, this initiative requires that we explore alternatives to attract greater numbers. The following represent ideas for new credentials within the field of graphic design. 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ontario Colleges Advanced Diploma</li>
	<p>
		This is the existing three-year program. 
	</p>
	<strong>Pros</strong> 
	<ul>
		<li>Well established</li>
		<li>Huge alumni population working in local industry who are program champions</li>
		<li>Excellent reputation</li>
		<li>Deep learning of the craft</li>
		<li>Record of ever-evolving curriculum</li>
	</ul>
	<strong>Cons</strong> 
	<ul>
		<li>Significant time commitmentâ€”three years</li>
		<li>Significant financial commitment</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Ontario Colleges Two Year Diploma</li>
	<p>
		This diploma would offer students in the three-year Advanced Diploma program an exit option after two years. This may require revision to college policies. The current curriculum may also need minor modifications to ensure it aligns with diploma program requirements. It does not represent a new, separate program with all the resourcing that would represent. 
	</p>
	<strong>Pros</strong> 
	<ul>
		<li>Shorter time to graduation, workforce</li>
		<li>Lower cost</li>
		<li>Appeal to international students?</li>
	</ul>
	<strong>Cons</strong> 
	<ul>
		<li>Time to implementation</li>
		<li>Missing third-year WIL experiences</li>
		<li>Missing third-year advanced curriculum</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		These are the stages required to create a two-year Ontario College Diploma Program. 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Alignment with the Ontario Qualifications Framework (OQF)</li>
		<li>Program Proposal Development</li>
		<li>Internal College Approval</li>
		<li>Credential Validation Service (CVS) Submission</li>
		<li>Ministry Notification and Funding Considerations</li>
		<li>Program Launch and Ongoing Review</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Micro-Credentials</li>
	<p>
		Micro-credentials are short, focused learning experiences designed to help learners quickly gain specific skills or knowledge. They may appeal to alumni of our program who wish to update their skills. They can also appeal to professionals not in the field of design who need to add particular skills. i.e. An administrative assistant who needs to make more appealing slide presentations. 
	</p>
	<strong>Pros</strong> 
	<ul>
		<li>Flexible: Often self-paced or part-time.</li>
		<li>Stackable: Can be combined with other micro-credentials or formal education.</li>
		<li>Industry-Aligned: Developed in collaboration with employers to meet current job market needs.</li>
		<li>Verifiable: Usually come with a digital badge or certificate.</li>
	</ul>
	<strong>Cons</strong> 
	<ul>
		<li>Micro-credentials often teach specific skills, which may not provide the broader context or critical thinking that full programs offer.</li>
		<li>They may not prepare learners for career shifts or leadership roles.</li>
		<li>Some micro-credentials are not publicly funded, making them less accessible to low-income learners.</li>
		<li>As more micro-credentials flood the market, their value may diminish unless rigour and quality are maintained.</li>
		<li>Micro-credentials may not transfer easily between institutions or count toward formal qualifications. This limits their usefulness for learners seeking to ladder up to diplomas or degrees.</li>
		<li>The focus on immediate employability can sideline foundational learning, creativity, and exploration.</li>
		<li>This may not serve students well in evolving industries like design, where adaptability and conceptual thinking are key.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
