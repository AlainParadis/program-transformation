	<li>Graphic design opens doors to careers in design, web design, animation, user experience design, advertising, and publishing.</li>
	<li>You’ll learn how to monetize your creativity while staying true to your artistic roots.</li>
	<li>Fieldwork and client-based projects introduce you to the business side of art—how to work with clients, meet deadlines, and present your work professionally.</li>
	<li>Good design is more than technical execution—it invokes emotion, addresses nuanced briefs, and resonates with specific audiences, qualities rooted in lived experience and intuition.</li>
	<li>AI empowers, not replaces, designers. It automates repetitive, technical tasks like resizing images, background removal, and formatting. This frees designers to focus on strategic, creative, and conceptual work. With AI handling production details, designers spend more time refining ideas, experimenting aesthetically, and solving complex problems.</li>
	<li>The designer remains the catalyst for design quality and meaning. AI tools require human direction, from prompts and feedback to creative vision. AI executes rather than imagines.</li>
	<li>Personalization and adapting designs to client-specific contexts is still a skill that requires direct understanding and consulting, where human designers excel.</li>
